Augmented Reaction
==================

A Sublime Text theme, inspired by the video game Vanquish and companion to the [iTerm colour scheme of the same name](https://github.com/ESWAT/augmented-reaction.itermcolors). Based off of [Centurion](https://github.com/allanhortle/Centurion) but removing even more unecessary decoration and chrome.

Installation
------------------------------------------------------------------------
###Package Control

Just install it and make sure to update your `Settings - User` file with:

    "theme": "Augmented Reaction.sublime-theme"


###Manual

Clone it into your packages directory. These are OSX paths because I'm lazy like that. For Windows/Other just substitute your paths like a boss.

    cd ~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/Packages

    git clone git://github.com/ESWAT/augmentedreaction-theme.git 'Theme - Augmented Reaction'

Make sure you have the `Theme - Augmented Reaction` at the end of the command so it is placed in the correct folder.
Unless of course you feel like experiencing the wrath of no icons.

Back to Sublime Text, press `super+,` to access your `Settings - User` and insert:

        "theme": "Augmented Reaction.sublime-theme"

If it looks like crap make sure to restart Sublime before crying.
